# Task 01 â€” Backend: Threads OAuth Authentication

## Description
Implement Threads OAuth flow on the backend. Exchange authorization codes for tokens, link Threads accounts to users, and issue secure application sessions (JWT + refresh token via httpOnly cookies).

## Acceptance Criteria
- `POST /auth/threads/start` returns redirect URL for OAuth
- `GET /auth/threads/callback` handles provider response; creates/links account
- Secure session cookies issued; refresh rotation implemented
- Secrets loaded from env; no secrets in code
- Unit tests covering token handling, error branches, CSRF/state handling

## Dependencies
- None (first backend task)

## Effort & Priority
- Effort: M
- Priority: P0

## Technical Specs
- Framework: FastAPI with dependency-injected services via `Depends`
- OAuth client: `authlib` + `httpx.AsyncClient`; enforce state/PKCE validation where supported
- JWT/session issuance handled with `python-jose` (JWT) and secure, httpOnly refresh cookies
- Store refresh tokens as hashes; rotate on use inside a transactional service layer
- Configuration via `pydantic-settings`; keep parity between local, staging, and production env files

## User Stories
- As a user, I can sign in with Threads
- As a user, I can revoke my session securely
