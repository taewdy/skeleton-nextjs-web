## Update db schema

- refer to docs/reference/threads_postman_collection.json for Threads API details and update 
  - users
  - thread_accounts
  - posts
 under ## Database Schema (Relational Outline) in docs/02-design/architecture-design.md
 - we might have different table name and fields to match the data structure from Threads API
